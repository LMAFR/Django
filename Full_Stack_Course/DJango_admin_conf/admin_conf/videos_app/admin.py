    # that we have defined in this line:
    search_fields = ["title", "length"]
    # We can also add filters for each field using the line below:
    list_filter = ('release_year', 'length')
    # We can modify the fields that are previsualized in the admin modelÂ´s page using the line below (this replaces 
    # the string representation we had previously assigned). This also allow us to order the model database by one 
    # of those fields, clicking in the column:
    list_display = ["title", "release_year", "length"]
    # We can also make attributes to be editable directly from the previsualized table using the line below:
    list_editable = ["length"]
# Register your models here. In this case we add the MovieAdmin model to indicate the order of the Movie model:
admin.site.register(models.Customer)
admin.site.register(models.Movie, MovieAdmin)
